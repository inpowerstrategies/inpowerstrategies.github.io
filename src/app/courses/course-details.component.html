                <h1>The Program</h1>
                <p>
                    We know that there are a lot of options when it comes to self-defence courses. Here's a little bit about what you'll learn from ours.
                </p>


                <h4>What we're focusing on</h4>
                <p>
                    The Stay Safe Course covers 4 critical areas.
                </p>

                <h6>Falling</h6>
                <p>
                    This may seem like an odd one, but learning how to fall safely is a skill that is applicable to a range of situations, throughout your lifetime!
                </p>
                <h6>Striking</h6>
                <p>
                    While striking does encompass what you might imagine, well strikes! We also show you how it can help with making space and maintaining your personal space (catchy mnemonics included!).
                </p>
                <h6>Blocking</h6>
                <p>
                    In this segment we cover knowing where the more vulnerable areas are on your body and how to try to best protect them – from standing and on the ground.
                </p>
                <h6>Throwing</h6>
                <p>
                    Our personal favourite, learning a few basic throws is helpful not just as a tool in your toolbox, but also offers alternative ways of dealing with a situation and helps introduce higher levels of physical contact in a more comfortable, fun way.
                </p>

                <h1>Outside The Program</h1>
                <p>
                    We'll also provide some situational examples of when these could be applied during the course.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Stick around after to come and grab some coffee at the local café with us!
